# Project Cortex

**Cortex** is an ambitious project to build a dynamic, interactive knowledge base that mimics the thought processes of the human brain. Designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 5, Cortex aims to provide real-time graph visualizations, AI-powered insights, and a user-friendly interface for exploring and expanding knowledge.

## Project Overview

Cortex is more than a database; it's a living system that organizes, visualizes, and interacts with information in a way that feels intuitive and alive. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like graph databases, real-time rendering, and AI, Cortex transforms how knowledge is stored, retrieved, and visualized.

Take a look at the [Project Roadmap](Docs/ROADMAP.md) to see the planned phases and milestones for Cortex.
