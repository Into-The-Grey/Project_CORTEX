## Project Vision

**Cortex** is a knowledge base designed to emulate a dynamic and interactive system that can be visualized in real-time and interact with AI for advanced insights. The goal is to create a highly interactive and extensible platform for storing, exploring, and expanding knowledge in a way that mirrors human thought processes.

2. **Data Types**:
   - What kinds of data will you store?
     - Text, images, videos, etc.
     - Structured or unstructured data.
     - Metadata or tags.
     - Relationships between data.
     - User-generated content.
     - External data sources.
     - Historical data or logs.
     - Real-time data streams.

3. **Future Vision**:
   - What features or capabilities might you want in the long term?
     - Semantic Search
     - Dynamic relationship discovery
     - AI-guided queries or chat interfaces
     - Integration with external APIs or data sources
     - Self-expanding knowledge base
     - Real-time collaboration or sharing
     - Mobile or voice interfaces
     - Advanced visualization or analytics
     - Integration with other AI tools or platforms

## **Core Features**

### Must-Have Features

- **Real-Time Graph Visualization**  
  - Display the knowledge base as a dynamic, interactive graph. Users can zoom, pan, and click on nodes to explore details.  
  - Show query traversal paths in real-time (e.g., highlight the relationships used to retrieve data).  

- **Interactive Querying and Retrieval**  
  - Support for running queries to find data and its relationships.  
  - Users or AI should be able to traverse the graph using structured queries or predefined paths.  

- **Support for Structured and Unstructured Data**  
  - Store structured data (e.g., tables, relationships) and unstructured data (e.g., text, documents, metadata).  

- **User-Friendly CRUD Operations**  
  - A straightforward way for users to create, update, and delete nodes and relationships.  

- **Error Handling and Logging**  
  - Detailed error messages for failed operations.  
  - Logging mechanisms for debugging and monitoring performance.  

- **Remote Access**  
  - Ensure the knowledge base can be accessed and managed from outside the local network via secure connections (e.g., SSH, HTTPS).  

- **Authentication and Authorization**  
  - Basic user authentication (e.g., passwords, tokens).  
  - Role-based access control to prevent unauthorized modifications or viewing of sensitive data.

### Nice-to-Have Features

- **AI-Assisted Relationship Mapping**  
  - Automatically suggest or create relationships between entities based on contextual similarity or semantic analysis.  

- **Integration with External Data Sources**  
  - Pull data from APIs, web scraping, or other sources to enrich the knowledge base.  

- **Semantic Search and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
  - Allow users to query the knowledge base in plain English (e.g., "Show me all articles about cybersecurity connected to John").  
  - Use vector-based similarity searches to retrieve contextually similar data.  

- **Real-Time Collaboration**  
  - Multiple users can access and edit the knowledge base simultaneously.  
  - Changes are synchronized in real-time with version control for conflicts.

## **Conceptual Data Model**

1. **Key Entities**  
   - **Nodes**:  
     - Articles: Store content, titles, authors, etc.  
     - Topics: Broad categories or tags (e.g., AI, Security, Raspberry Pi).  
     - People: Authors, collaborators, or referenced individuals.  
     - Events: Specific occurrences linked to nodes (e.g., conferences, releases).  
     - Sources: Links to external documents, websites, or resources.  

2. **Relationships**  
   - Articles are **TAGGED_WITH** Topics.  
   - Articles are **WRITTEN_BY** People.  
   - Articles or Topics are **REFERENCES** Sources.  
   - People are **CONNECTED_TO** other People (e.g., collaborators).  
   - Articles are **MENTIONS** Events.  

3. **Hierarchy or Grouping**  
   - Topics can have sub-topics (e.g., "AI" -> "Neural Networks").  
   - People can be grouped into teams or organizations.  
   - Articles can be grouped by publication date or source.

## **Resource Constraints**

1. **Raspberry Pi Limits**  
   - **Memory**: The 8GB RAM is sufficient for mid-sized databases but could struggle with very large datasets or complex AI models. Optimize for lightweight solutions.  
   - **CPU**: Complex graph queries or real-time visualizations may cause slowdowns; consider caching or precomputing frequent queries.  
   - **Storage**: Limited by the storage medium (SD card or external drive). Ensure data backup and regular cleanup.  

2. **Tools/Technologies**  
   - **Database**: Neo4j for native graph operations or PostgreSQL for relational + vector extensions (e.g., pgvector).  
   - **Frontend**: 3d-force-graph or three.js for real-time 3D visualization.  
   - **Backend**: Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express) for APIs and real-time WebSocket communication.  
   - **AI**: External APIs for heavier AI tasks (e.g., OpenAI) or lightweight local solutions for Raspberry Pi.

## Next Steps

- Refine this vision with specific examples and requirements.
- Break this down into actionable tasks for development.
- Identify potential challenges or risks and plan mitigation strategies.
- Start prototyping key features to validate the concept and technology stack.
- Establish a roadmap with milestones and deliverables to track progress.
- Consider open-sourcing the project to attract contributors and expand the feature set.
