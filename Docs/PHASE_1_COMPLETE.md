# PHASE 1 COMPLETE ðŸŽ‰

## Summary

Congratulations on completing Phase 1: **Brainstorming & Vision**! This marks the official start of Project Cortex as a thoughtfully planned and ambitious initiative.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **ROADMAP.md**: A comprehensive and detailed roadmap to guide the development of Cortex across all phases.  
2. **VISION.md**: A polished vision statement that defines the scope, goals, features, and conceptual model for the knowledge base.  
3. **Core Features**: Clearly outlined must-haves and nice-to-haves to ensure steady progress.  
4. **Conceptual Data Model**: A realistic and flexible foundation for storing and managing knowledge.  
5. **Acknowledgment of Constraints**: Practical understanding of the Raspberry Pi 5â€™s hardware limitations and chosen tools.  

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Phase 2: **Environment & Infrastructure Setup**  

- In the next phase, weâ€™ll set up the foundational tools and technologies needed to bring Cortex to life.  
- This will include:
  - Configuring the Raspberry Pi environment.
  - Installing and setting up the database (Neo4j, PostgreSQL, or both).
  - Preparing the development environment for smooth iteration.  
  - Ensuring security and remote access.

Take a moment to celebrate this milestoneâ€”itâ€™s a significant achievement! ðŸŽ‰  
When youâ€™re ready, weâ€™ll dive into Phase 2 and continue building Cortex, one step at a time.

**End of Phase 1** ðŸš€
